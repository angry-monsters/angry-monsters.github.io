- implement better calculation method for encounter threat (list # of PCs? Handle higher tier monsters?)
- fix file uploads so that they run when clicked not on a change
- add step value to numerical input fields
- add abbreviated stat blocks for encounters (+ markdown?)
- higher resolution statblock download
- add automatic interaction between ability scores and values from the monster stats by tier table
- line overflow on encounter block
- CR calculator / backwards compatibility
