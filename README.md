## Compendium
To contribute to the bestiary, go to the issues page, create a new compendium addition, and attach your file. To use, download the file and load into the monster manager.

## Goals:
- add abbreviated stat blocks for encounters (+ markdown?)
- add automatic interaction between ability scores and values from the monster stats by tier table

## Maybe:
- fix file uploads so that they run when clicked not on a change
- higher resolution statblock download
- CR calculator / backwards compatibility
