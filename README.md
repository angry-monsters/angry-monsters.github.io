## Compendium
To contribute to the bestiary, go to the issues page, create a new compendium addition, and attach your file. To use, download the file and load into the monster manager.

## New Feature Priorities from 7/15-7/29 survey (not in order):
- UX/UI improvements (separate data entry and statblock formatting, work on one section at a time, separate monster I/O)

## Update Priorities
- Traits to CR calc / CR adjustor
- Paragon / dismemberment HP pools to encounter, Markdown and printable block (css)
- morale, bonus actions/reactions to abbreviated statblocks
- toggle light / dark theme, switch color palette
- responsive layout & icons
- fix loading of archetypes (guess if one applies and load)
- reload and stay on the same tab
