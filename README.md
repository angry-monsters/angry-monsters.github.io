## Compendium
To contribute to the bestiary, go to the issues page, create a new compendium addition, and attach your file. To use, download the file and load into the monster manager.

## Priorities from 7/15-7/29 survey (not in order):
- Traits to CR calc
- Encounter XP: input or adjusted from CR
- Keyword filters for bestiary
- Paragon / dismemberment HP pools to Markdown
- Form to upload bestiaries
- UX/UI improvements (separate data entry and statblock formatting, work on one section at a time, separate monster I/O)
- Print whole encounters or bestiaries
- Monster editing from bestiary replaces old monster
